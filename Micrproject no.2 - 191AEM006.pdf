\section{Introduction}
We were supposed to create a mini website using Hugo. It is the micro-project of module 473 - fall. After creting the website we need to put the link into Github and deploy the site into Netlify.
in the website we need to introduce ourselves, put links about our media and our github portfolio. 

I tried too many times to complete this project but i can't with my laptop.because installing Ubuntu was too much time consuming and after trying too many times i finally downloaded the Ubuntu using virtualbox. But then again i couldn't connect to the internet, i tried so many example codes to solve the issue "No wi-fi adaptor" but i couldn't even until now. Following are the codes i tried.

@sudo apt-get update
@sudo apt install git build-essential dkms
@git clone -b extended https://github.com/lwfingerrtlwifi_new.git
@sudo dkms add ./rtlwifi_new
@sudo dkms install rtlwifi_new!

And then reboot and nothing found. the only response i got are;
